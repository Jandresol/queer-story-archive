    excerpt: "Navigating the intersections of Black and queer identity at Harvard.",
    year: "Class of 2019",
    content: "Growing up in a conservative Southern community, I never saw examples of Black queer joy. Coming to Harvard meant finding community for the first time, but it also meant navigating spaces where I was often either the only Black person or the only queer person.\n\nThrough student organizations and wonderful mentors, I found my people - other Black queer students who understood the unique challenges and joys of our intersectional identities. We created our own spaces when we couldn't find them, organizing events that celebrated all parts of who we are.\n\nMy four years at Harvard weren't always easy, but they were transformative. I learned to embrace all aspects of my identity and found the language to express experiences I'd always felt but couldn't name. Most importantly, I found family.",

    excerpt: "Finding home through cultural student organizations as a gay Latino student.",
    year: "Class of 2021",
    content: "When I arrived at Harvard from my hometown in Texas, I immediately sought out the Latinx student organizations, hoping to find a piece of home. But I was nervous about being fully myself in those spaces - would my queerness be accepted?\n\nIt took me nearly a year to come out to my friends in these organizations. What I found was overwhelming support, love, and many others like me who were navigating similar intersectional identities.\n\nThrough cultural celebrations, political activism, and late-night conversations in the dining hall, I built a community that embraced all parts of me. These experiences taught me that I don't have to compartmentalize different aspects of my identity - I can be fully Latinx and fully queer at the same time.",

    excerpt: "Creating space for South Asian queer women on campus.",
    year: "Class of 2020",
    content: "As an Indian-American lesbian, I often felt invisible in both South Asian and queer spaces at Harvard. In South Asian cultural events, heteronormativity was the unspoken norm, while in LGBTQ+ spaces, white perspectives frequently dominated.\n\nDuring my sophomore year, I connected with a few other South Asian queer women, and we began meeting informally for chai and conversations about our unique experiences. These gatherings grew into a more formal organization dedicated to creating community for queer South Asians on campus.\n\nThrough panels, cultural events, and just being visible together, we challenged stereotypes and created representation for others like us. These spaces were healing and affirming in ways I hadn't experienced before. For the first time, I felt I could be my complete self without translation or explanation.",

    excerpt: "Discovering gender identity and expression during freshman year.",
    year: "Class of 2022",
    content: "Before Harvard, I never had the language or freedom to explore my gender identity. Coming from a small conservative town, I presented the way people expected me to, even though it never felt right.\n\nCollege gave me the space to experiment with presentation and to connect with other nonbinary students of color who were on similar journeys. From trying new pronouns to exploring gender-affirming clothing, each step was both terrifying and liberating.\n\nIn my African American studies classes, I found theoretical frameworks that helped me understand how gender, race, and sexuality intersect. These academic insights, combined with supportive friends and mentors, gave me the courage to fully embrace my nonbinary identity.\n\nToday, I'm more comfortable in my skin than I've ever been, and I'm grateful for the community that supported me through this journey of self-discovery.",

    excerpt: "Reconciling faith, culture, and sexuality as a Korean American bisexual student.",
    year: "Class of 2018",
    content: "The hardest part of my Harvard experience was reconciling my conservative Christian Korean background with my bisexuality. For years, I compartmentalized these aspects of my identity, being one person with my Korean Christian friends and another with my queer friends.\n\nThe turning point came when I found a small group of LGBTQ+ Asian students who were also people of faith. Together, we explored theologies that affirmed rather than rejected our sexualities. We shared strategies for talking to our families and navigating cultural expectations.\n\nWhat I learned through these conversations was that integration, not compartmentalization, was the path to wholeness. I didn't have to choose between my faith, my culture, and my sexuality â€“ I could honor all of these parts of myself.\n\nThough I'm still on this journey, Harvard gave me the foundation to start building a life where I don't have to hide any part of who I am.",
