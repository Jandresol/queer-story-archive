I was involved in Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners (HUCP) from freshman through junior year and started advocacy work with Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies (TAPAS) during Visitas in 2021 and am an active organizer today.

    identity: `April 2025, I clarified my understanding of navigating romance in this world. I defined the only difference between platonic and romantic love as a mutual desire to create a monogamous committed relationship. This definition applies to both men and women, so I now identify as bisexual. Before, this understanding, I was lesbian- because there were so few men I was interested in getting to know as a dear friend, I believed I had no interest in pursuing a deep comradeship with men, let alone a romantic relationship.`,
    harvard: `I have loved my time on this campus. TAPAS has served as such a safe, encouraging, and critical community to enact impactful labor and find new ways to organize. I have worked with them to create a community fridge in Chinatown, book clubs including Fearing the Black Body by Sabrina Strings, a campus flea market with proceeds donated for wages in South/Southeast Asia and climate work, and an APIDA community art show. Attending and organizing protests, phonebanking, and scholar lectures are a part of the work as well. Constantly learning and working has been nothing short of fulfilling. People are nuanced- nothing is without perspective, and I wish all students and institutions understood this better about everyone.`,

I love learning about queer history centered on dance as a form of resistance so this album embodied that for me and made me feel empowered.",
    excerpt: "Journey of self-discovery as a Black Lesbian.",
    year: "Class of 2027",
    identity: `Coming to terms with my queerness was a long and difficult journey, that I‚Äôm continuing to navigate and work through to learn more about myself. Growing up in a family that hasn‚Äôt always made it feel safe/comfortable to come out or authentically be myself, I still worry that they will not be accepting and still haven‚Äôt came out due to this. For some time, I identified as unlabeled, wrestling with societal homophobia, compulsory heterosexuality and the deeply ingrained idea that women are meant for men, which made embracing the label lesbian feel scary and isolating. I read the classic Lesbian masterdoc, read articles, found some communities on social media and started to develop a sense of belonging but also fear. I realized quickly after this that unlabeled was not right for me and genuinely made me feel uncomfortable and that I was definitely lesbian. The intersections of societal homophobia, misogyny, and being Black/African American women compounded the struggle, making it feel like I was carrying multiple weights just to be myself. But finding community here at Harvard has helped with this and I‚Äôm prouder than ever now to be Lesbian and to be myself.`,
    harvard: `Navigating Harvard as a Black, African American and Balkan lesbian woman has been both empowering and isolating at times, as I often find myself balancing pride in my identity with the challenge of feeling fully seen in predominantly white and cis-heteronormative spaces. Being involved in advocacy and resistance through groups like the African and African American Resistance Organization and the Generational African American Student Association has been a powerful way for me to reclaim space and uplift voices like mine. These spaces have taught me that resistance isn‚Äôt just about protest but also about building collation, a collective; also belonging, and healing. I wish more students and the institution understood that Queer POC experiences are shaped by layered struggles that can‚Äôt fully be separated or ‚Äúothered‚Äù depending on the circumstance. Racism, homophobia, and cultural erasure are apart of the struggles of being a queer POC and I hope folks learn that true inclusion means actively addressing those intersections.`,

    excerpt: "Navigating the intersections of Latine and queer identity at Harvard.",
    year: "Class of 2028",
    identity: `My journey has been interesting. I first came out of the closet when I was in the 5th grade to all of my friends. Surprisingly, everyone took it well and nobody was mean about it. However, I moved and went back into the closet because I was afraid. I didn‚Äôt come out again until 7th grade to some close friends and I officially came out in the 8th grade. 

    I never got to come out to my parents because they both passed away. I was 8 when my mother passed away and had no idea about my sexuality. I was 15 when my father passed away yet I was too afraid to ever say anything. Growing up religious and in a Latino family, many family members held traditional beliefs, most of them stemming from religious beliefs. My sister is queer and when she came out to my mother, she had a priest come over and bless my sister. 
    
    I never experienced any of this because I began living with my sister when I was 10. I was raised by her and her girlfriend. I was always in a queer space that made me comfortable to be myself. Today, I am extremely proud to be queer and I am a part of the Queer Students Association.`,
    harvard: `Harvard has been a great experience. It is the most liberal place and accepting place I‚Äôve been in. Despite living in Massachusetts, I live in a fairly conservative town. The spaces I‚Äôve felt most seen here are usually the affinity spaces such as Latine and queer spaces. While I‚Äôve been here I actually done much activism or organizing. Before getting on campus, I thought I would be doing a lot of great work and unfortunately I haven‚Äôt. However, I am awe of everyone who has and sometimes I wish that were me. Their work is so important and even if I‚Äôm not doing anything directly, supporting them is extremely important. 

    Lastly, I wish other students understood that are identities are not separate. They‚Äôre layered and cause a specific type of oppression. Many will never fully understand but most will try to understand and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs important.`,

    excerpt: "Redefining Black Womanhood.",
    year: "Class of 2027",
    identity: `Growing up as a Black girl in a predominantly white area, I often felt out of place. Unlike many of my peers at Harvard, I had little exposure to my own culture beyond the my family home. This sense of alienation made family values and keeping up with tradition all the more important. I was raised with traditional gender roles and family values, yet I never found myself aligned with them. From an early age, I felt detached from the expectations placed on young women. I had no interest in marriage, prom, or the rites of passage that were supposed to define girlhood. These feelings, compounded by racial isolation, deeply complicated my understanding of self. The idea of "Black girlhood", connoted hyper-femininity and performance due to the hypermasculinization of our black bodies. I was also told from a young age that Black women are the least desirable, implanting the idea that I must work hard to be loved. I found myself struggling to keep up with the prevalence of desirability politics within white spaces as disconnected from the cultural expectations of Black womanhood. This led me to question, if I didn't belong in any of these frameworks, then who was I? Over time, I gravitated toward identities that resonated with my lived experience, including nonbinary and genderqueer. Eventually, coming to terms with my sexuality and gender as a Lesbian woman was a pivotal shift. I began to understand that my discomfort was not a failure to conform, but rather a sign that the heteronormative structures I had tried to fit into were never meant for me.`,
    harvard: `I felt like Harvard was the first place I could embrace my queerness for the first time. Through Queer spaces, I was able to find community and cultivate strong friendships. I recall during my freshman year going down to the Quoffice at least once a month to join in on the events hosted. My favorites being the Black affinity spaces or the Halloween pumpkin painting session. Through the parties, I was also able to meet new people, including my current girlfriend. In my freshman year, I felt like Harvard was an amazing place to be out and proud. However, I do feel like there has been a shift. During this school year, I felt smaller numbers across all affinity spaces, but especially queer ones. I've noticed that affirmative action might have impacted the queer population strongly, even if not directly, due to shifting of priorities away from cultivating a diverse student body. I think also with personal circumstances of having a stronger courseload, trying to get a job, etc. I've personally felt less in touch with the Queer Harvard community. Now with the Trump administration looming, I can only begin to think this is the start of a downward trend of losing our community spaces. I can only hope that we as a marginalized group stay strongly connected and remain resilient in a time where our rights can be taken away at a moment's notice.`,

    intro: `Jama is a senior in Winthrop House pursuing a joint concentration in Government and African and African American Studies, with a secondary in Arts, Film, and Visual Studies. In Government, he is on the Public Policy track, focusing on foreign and social policy, while his studies in African and African American Studies center on Afro-Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Originally from Kingston, Jamaica, he now resides in Barstow, California.

    Jama has held leadership roles as Co-President of the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative (HUFPI). He has been a Mellon Mays Fellow and a Radcliffe Research Fellow for the past three years. He also works as a Student Worker for Harvard College‚Äôs Office of BGLTQ Student Life, where he has organized events with the Winner of RuPaul's Drag Race - Nymphia Wind, Jeremy Pope, and Representative Mark Takano '83 (D-CA 39th). Additionally, he is an active member of the Institute of Politics and Harvard Men‚Äôs Club Volleyball.

    Jama has also worked with the U.S. Department of State for the past two years, focusing on human rights issues in Latin America and the Caribbean. His senior thesis, "Decriminalizing ‚ÄòBuggery‚Äô Laws in the Postcolonial Anglophone Caribbean," provides a comparative analysis of efforts to repeal colonial-era anti-LGBTQ+ laws across the Caribbean, examining their relationship to contemporary transnational networks`,
    name: "Jama",
    song: "Never Enough - Loren Allred",
    excerpt: "Challenging Political and Institutional Frameworks",
    year: "Class of 2025",
    identity: `I was raised in Jamaica, a place where non-normative identities are both hyper-visible and strategically erased‚Äîwhere colonial-era laws continue to criminalize intimacy and self-expression, reinforced not just by statutes but by silence. As someone born in the United States but raised in the Caribbean, I‚Äôve always inhabited a space in between: neither fully protected by privilege nor fully disempowered by marginalization. My identity has never operated in isolation‚Äîit is shaped by race, class, being a first-generation student, and a religious upbringing that taught both belonging and exclusion.

A pivotal moment came when I began working alongside Caribbean scholars and activists like Professor Tracy Robinson and Matthew Chin. Through their work, I came to understand that the criminalization of people like me wasn‚Äôt inevitable but manufactured‚Äîimposed through colonial rule and later defended in the name of national respectability. That insight gave language to something I had long felt: my life was not a contradiction to be resolved but a history to be reclaimed. I stopped seeking to reconcile disparate parts of myself and instead began to mobilize them as tools for justice.

Over time, my understanding of identity has become less about self-definition and more about structural intervention. It is not just a matter of who I am, but how I engage the world‚Äîhow I advocate, how I craft policy, how I imagine freedom. My lived experience has become the framework through which I interrogate power and push institutions to reckon with the histories they obscure.
`,
    harvard: `Harvard has been both a proving ground and a battleground. It grants prestige while demanding constant translation. In classrooms, I‚Äôve often had to contextualize legal and historical frameworks for peers unfamiliar with postcolonial realities. The institution celebrates diversity rhetorically, but often resists the kind of discomfort that real inclusion requires. Navigating Harvard as someone with my background means constantly justifying the stakes of issues others have the privilege to overlook.

Still, I‚Äôve found strength in community‚Äîespecially among other students of color whose identities, like mine, exist at the intersection of personal history and political urgency. The spaces where I feel most seen are the ones that value both vulnerability and strategy‚Äîspaces where people know how to turn shared experience into collective power.

My advocacy has been rooted in both policy and presence‚Äîfrom coordinating with civil society leaders in the Caribbean and the UK to giving a ted-talk style speech at the Institute of Politics. To me, advocacy is not about visibility alone‚Äîit‚Äôs about accountability and redistribution. It‚Äôs about challenging the systems that render our experiences peripheral.

What I wish more students and administrators understood is this: people like me are not just enduring institutions like Harvard‚Äîwe are reshaping them. We should not have to translate our existence into theory in order to be respected. Institutions should not just tolerate our presence; they should rise to meet our vision.

    identity: `My high school was predominantly white & affluent, so it was a space where queerness was more openly discussed. I was very grateful to have this space away from home to explore myself and to be exposed to the possibility of being openly queer. Home was deeply marked by the legacy of colonialism in the Caribbean‚Äì‚Äìmeaning it was not a fully safe space for anything queer. Although, if you look hard enough, Caribbean culture is very queer!
I identify as queer, which might be a bit politically charged in how it encompasses the way I don't resonate with social notions of gender.`,
