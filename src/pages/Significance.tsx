                Documenting the lived experiences of Queer People of Color at Harvard is not just an act of preservation;
                it is a radical act of resistance. It is a way to reclaim our narratives, challenge the erasure of our histories,
                and affirm our identities in a world that often seeks to silence us.

            <p>
            Activism has long served as a crucial force in challenging systems of oppression and advocating for marginalized communities, especially those whose voices are often silenced or ignored. The queer liberation movement, radical feminist movement, and the Black Power movement. Each emerged from a refusal to accept invisibility, violence, and systemic injustice. These movements, though different in their primary focus, share a common goal: to empower those who have been historically oppressed to reclaim agency and demand dignity, justice, and representation. For queer people of color, particularly Black queer individuals, these movements intersect in ways that deeply inform their lived experiences and their fight for liberation.

            <p>
            The queer liberation movement, sparked by figures like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, challenged both heteronormative systems and racism within the LGBTQ+ community. Radical feminism also birthed essential critiques of patriarchal power structures, the gender binary and its oppression of women, as well as what it meant to deter from the heteronormativenlens and societal structures placed on women. Which queer women and gender nonconforming individuals built upon to push for a more inclusive feminism. Simultaneously, the Black Power movement and the Black Panther Party promoted self-determination, community care, and a bold resistance to white supremacy and police violence/brutality. Together, these movements laid the groundwork for understanding the compounded layers of identity and oppression that queer POC, especially Black queer people navigate every day.

            <p>
            At Harvard, this fight for recognition and respect continues. The presence of a growing queer POC community, one that is resilient, creative, and unapologetically proud demands not only attention and care but also celebration of queerness in all its forms. Elevating the stories of queer folks and their identities and lived experiences is not just a matter of diversity and inclusion, but of justice. Their experiences, contributions, and leadership are vital to the fabric of this institution, and must be treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve.

            </p>
            
            <p>
            This project, rooted in honoring those histories and uplifting present-day voices, aims to shine a light on queer POC experiences and ensure they are seen and valued. It recognizes the steady strength and growth of this community at Harvard, and calls for others to bear witness, listen, and not only affirm their existence but honor it and allow queer POC individuals to thrive and exist authentically as themselves everyday. In doing so, it continues the radical tradition of resistanceâ€”one that insists that Black queer lives matter, not only in the face of adversity, but in celebration, creativity, and being.
