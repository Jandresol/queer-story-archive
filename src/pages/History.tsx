                The Queer Archives Project is a response to the urgent need for a more inclusive and 
                intersectional understanding of queer history. By centering the voices and experiences of 
                Queer People of Color, we aim to challenge the dominant narratives that have historically 
                marginalized these communities.

            <p>
              To start off with some historical context and background, we can begin by examining one of the most pivotal movements in queer liberation history, the Stonewall protests. These protests began on June 28th, 1969, after the New York City police officers raided Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. At the time, being gay/queer was still considered illegal, and engaging in gay relationships led to the possibility of being arrested and subjected to intense violence and criminalization. Gay bars in New York City were considered safe havens and places of refuge for many queer individuals to be free to express themselves and authentically be queer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In the morning of June 28th, 1969 about nine police officers had entered the Stonewall Inn bar in an attempt to arrest employees and patrons most of whom were Black and Brown for selling alcohol without a permitted license. The pivotal moment that sparked a collective fight for rights among lesbians, gays, and transgender people was when individuals chose to resist the police instead of dispersing and leaving the bar. For the next six days, more protests occurred and organizing became a staple for resistance and safety.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">Key Figures in the Movement</h3>
            
            <p>
              Some of the most prominent figures that led the Stonewall riot and reshaped the way we view queer activism were Black/POC queer women. Activists like Stormé DeLarverie, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were the reason Stonewall grew in size, in traction, and became a very important mark in queer history.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Marsha P. Johnson</strong> was a "self-proclaimed drag queen"/assumed Trans Women who advocated for trans rights, homeless people, individuals living with HIV/AIDS, and the incarcerated. She pushed back against police aggression and brutality during the riots and advocated for the voices of trans people of color, particularly the voices of Black trans women. A lover of art, she also modeled for artists like Andy Warhol and participated in the drag troupe "Hot Peaches". Johnson also co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Sylvia Rivera to support homeless LGBTQ youth.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              <strong>Stormé DeLarverie</strong>, born to an African American mother and White father, DeLarverie became a gay civil rights icon that changed the way society perceived lesbians. Many say was the first to throw a punch at a police officer on the first day of the Stonewall riots and was the spark that pushed the uprising of Stonewall. Also a butch lesbian, and a trailblazer for gender fluidity, expression, and nonconformity, she gave a voice to lesbians who felt in touch with masculinity and became an example of what it meant to break gender norms and to live outside the heteronormative box. According to other people and activists at the time and even today DeLarverie was considered the "Rosa Parks of queer activism", truly setting an example and becoming a leader in her community.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">Intersectional Activism and Community Building</h3>
            
            <p>
              As demonstrated by the stories of Queer activists, authenticity, collective struggle, and the pursuit to exist fully and wholly as a queer person is an important part of history. The feeling of being marginalized, of wanting to fight oppressive structures like capitalism, homophobia, racism, and misogyny became a driving force for the organization. Without trailblazers like Johnson, Rivera, and DeLarverie, many ways in which we see queer activism today would not have the tools it currently does to continue growing, thriving, and breaking boundaries.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Activism is a crucial part of resistance and existence as a marginalized person. Allowing oneself to live authentically is a part of the queer experience. We look to bring light to activists that came before us and activists that we currently have. To applaud them for the organizing that they do, in the work that they produce that put forth a pathway for queer voices to continue being heard and for queer livelihood to always exist.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Recognizing the POC experience, particularly that of Black queer individuals, allows us to see how interconnected struggles against oppression truly are. Understanding racial discrimination deepens our awareness of other forms of marginalization, reinforcing the urgency of collective action. This urgency is reflected in the growing calls for visibility, highlighting the necessity of being seen and heard as a community.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Visibility and Storytelling</h3>
            
            <p>
              Understanding our collectivist activism in increasing calls for visibility highlights the importance of being seen and heard as a community. Visibility is not just about representation—it is about survival, power, and the ability to shape our own narratives. The urgency of making marginalized voices heard is a sentiment echoed by Patrisse Khan-Cullors in When They Call You a Terrorist, where she emphasizes the critical need to uplift Black lives and the ongoing fight against systemic erasure: "The urgency of our collective work cannot be overstated. For every Black life that is silenced, there are countless more waiting to be heard."
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This resonates with our aim to ensure Queer POC voices at Harvard are documented and celebrated, bridging past activism with present needs. By documenting the experiences of Queer POC at Harvard, we aim to ensure that these voices are no longer marginalized, echoing the ongoing fight for justice that Khan-Cullors articulates.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Influenced by Malcolm X's emphasis on self-definition in The Autobiography of Malcolm X where he writes, "I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it's for or against," we see storytelling as a way to reclaim narratives for queer people of color ensuring that their histories, struggles, and triumphs are not only remembered but actively shape the present and future of activism. Through storytelling, we create a bridge between past and present, amplifying the voices that history has often sought to silence. This commitment to preserving and uplifting marginalized voices is deeply rooted in the power of collective action and community-building—values that have long been at the heart of social movements.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">Community Building and Collective Liberation</h3>
            
            <p>
              Moreover, we are inspired by acts of community building to create unity. Reading Elaine Brown's A Taste of Power we were struck by her reflection on leading the Black Panthers: "I had to learn that power was not just a gun but a voice, a community." This inspired us to prioritize community-building through narrative, much like the Panthers' outreach programs. Likewise, Frances Beal's "Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female" from Sisterhood is Powerful, with its assertion, "Black women are both Black and women in a way that white women are not, and Black men are not"—pushed us to center intersectionality, recognizing Queer POC's unique positions at Harvard.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">The Combahee River Collective</h3>
            
            <p>
              Our project draws inspiration from the Combahee River Collective, whose emphasis on intersectionality and collective liberation echoes our mission. The Combahee River Collective (CRC) was a Black feminist, lesbian, and socialist group active in Boston from 1974 to 1980. The collective was formed to combat racism in white feminist movements and sexism in Civil Rights efforts. We are inspired by the intersectionality of past movements and seek to extend their community-building missions through our work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In its 1977 Statement, the CRC envisioned liberation for Black queer women, the most marginalized, as a key to dismantling all forms of injustice, including economic inequality rooted in capitalism that oppresses Black communities. Named for Harriet Tubman's 1863 Combahee River Raid, which freed over 750 enslaved people, the CRC stood for bold resistance. Though it dissolved after six years due to scarce funding and limited reach, its vision resonates in today's activism.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-queer-purple mt-8 mb-4">Our Framework</h3>
            
            <p>
              We develop our framework from revolutionary efforts of groups like the CRC, which exposed the interconnectedness of oppression. The CRC's legacy, forged at the crossroads of Black Power, Radical Feminism, and Gay Liberation core movements in our course guides us. These groups confronted overlapping injustices and fostered community through fearless visibility and collective action. Sylvia Rivera captured this shared struggle, saying, "We were all fighting the same thing: Oppression." Her words highlight the collective liberation at the heart of our work. By amplifying Queer POC voices at Harvard, we link our efforts to a rich history of intersecting fights for freedom and justice.
